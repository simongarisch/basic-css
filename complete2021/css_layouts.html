    <h2>CSS Layout and Positioning</h2>
    <p>The position property specifies the type of positioning method used for an element
    (static, relative, fixed, absolute or sticky).
    </p>

    <p>HTML elements are positioned static by default.
       Static positioned elements are not affected by the top, bottom, left and right properties.
    </p>

    <div id="div-static">This is an example div which will have a static position by default.
        It'll always be positioned according to the normal flow of the page.
    </div>

    <div id="div-relative">
        An element with position: relative is positioned relative to its normal position.
    </div>

    <div id="div-fixed">
        An element with position: fixed is positioned relative to the viewport,
        which means it always stays in the same place even if the page is scrolled.
        The top, right, bottom, and left properties are used to position the element.
    </div>

    <div>
        An element with position: absolute; is positioned relative to the nearest positioned ancestor
        (instead of positioned relative to the viewport, like fixed).
        <div id="div-absolute">
            This div element has position: absolute
        </div>
    </div>

    <div id="div-sticky">
        An element with position: sticky; is positioned based on the user's scroll position.
    </div>
