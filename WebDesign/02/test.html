            I did like Ben's book, but
            <i>irritatingly</i>
            he kept going on about Scones. For example:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
            All this writing about scones in our sample page and there's no
            image of the beauties! I'm going to add in an image of a scone near
            the top of the page; a sort of 'hero' image to entice users to read
            the page.
