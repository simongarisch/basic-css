/*
The position property specifies the type of positioning method used for an element (static, relative, fixed, absolute or sticky).

HTML elements are positioned static by default.

An element with position: relative; is positioned relative to its normal position.

An element with position: fixed; is positioned relative to the viewport, which means it always stays in the same place even if the page is scrolled.

An element with position: absolute; is positioned relative to the nearest positioned ancestor (instead of positioned relative to the viewport, like fixed).

An element with position: sticky; is positioned based on the user's scroll position.
